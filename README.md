Warrior's VSM Rework v. pre-1.0

IMPORTANT

This mod is not compatible with any other mods that edit ItemDataTable.uasset file, such as:
Jugulator's Gameplay Review (WEAPONS pak);
Gunfighter Gameplay Improvement;
Everything Unlocked;
Real Weapon Names with More Guns and Attachments;
This mod already contains the Glock 19 TTI Mag Extension, huge thanks to Ninomaelsshin416 for letting me use his mod;

CHANGES

WEAPONS   &   EQUIPMENT

Added realistic names for all weapons, including grenades, as well as edited a few descriptions;

Added the 9-banger with custom loadout menu icon: 
    The fuse delay is set to 1.5 seconds and redetonation delay is set to 0.25 of a second, 
    Tweaked the redetonation VFX, again, huge thanks to Ninomaelsshin416 for allowing me to reverse engineer his file;

Rebalanced recoil values for all weapons: 
    FAL is now somewhat usable, still kicks like a truck but at least you're not shooting the ceiling after 3 rounds;

Lowered the weapon's inertia values, they won't sway so much when turning or strafing; 

All primary weapons and long tactical items were given a new perspective: 
    This gives the look of the character pressing weapons more into the shoulder, 
    These changes were made to visualize new inertia values;

All handguns were given a new perspective: 
    This change was inspired by the way of how handguns are held in Ground Branch; 

Similarly to Jug's rework and Gunfighter, I've included the low-ready when colliding with objects, also inspired by Ground Branch,

Door wedges are now 3 per slot (vanilla 2)

Both heavy and light vest now have 14 slots 

MOVEMENT

Tweaked movement speed:
    Increased base run and walk speeds, 
    Slightly faster movement when aiming,Faster moving speed when leaning, 
    When hit in a leg you lose 12.5% of overall movement speed for each time being hit, 
    Slower movement when carrying restrained suspects and civies; 

Slightly reduced screen shake while suppressed by enemy fire;

Character collision cylinder size reduced by about 10.5%:
    You are now able to get closer to walls and walk through doors with AI or other players simultaneously without getting stuck on each other, 
    This may create some clipping issues when walking into the walls while facing them directly and looking down, so unless you're really trying, you won't notice it; 

You are now able to turn your head by 90 degrees when using freelook (vanilla 65 degrees);

FUTURE PLANS

If I manage to figure out how to add new weapons I will add a few, most likely it will come as a collection for Vortex users (highly suggested for easy updates);
I'm not planning on working on the AI, there is plenty of amazing mods that do that;
I'm open to your suggestions, but keep in mind I may not add whatever you're asking me to, either because I don't like the idea or I simply don't know how to do it.

Thank you for downloading my mod, if you encounter any bugs be sure to post them on the Nexus page. I'll do my best to fix them.
